## Project Description:

Channel Sylph is a portfolio website built around the fictional concept of an eponymous television channel (network). The showcased projects are framed as “programs” by Channel Sylph and can all be accessed through the website. The concept of Channel Sylph is driven home through the overall content and aesthetic of the website, which all builds and portrays the philosophy and personality of the channel (this is most notable in the text of the About page). Through this *fictional* concept, visitors can get an idea of what the *actual* individual behind the website might be like. Channel Sylph is both a functional portfolio website and a creative realization of a fictional concept. 
 
## Process:

After looking through the various examples of portfolio websites that were provided as part of the course material, I found that I was most drawn to the portfolios that deviated from the standard formula and were not shy to incorporate an element of levity and fun. I myself was determined to create a unique portfolio website that was able to evoke this feeling of curiosity. As I let my mind drift, I found myself thinking of the Wii Menu (the main GUI of Nintendo’s Wii console) and its depiction of applications as “channels.” Thus the concept of Channel Sylph was born, and the general aesthetic of the website also took inspiration from that of the Wii Menu.

Construction began from the Home page, and this is the part that required the most time. Most of the stylistic decisions involving the CSS were made here (such as the font and the color palette). The biggest feature of the website is housed here: a collection of clickable images that represent the four “current programs” (projects) and redirects the visitor to the respective project. This was achieved by using the Flexbox module. The Programs page showcases a similar collection, except with a written description of each program—this was done by adding the text between the images in the flexbox containers and adjusting the widths accordingly.

The About page is mostly filled with text that describes the philosophy of Channel Sylph, thus serving to develop the fictional concept of Channel Sylph. The general spirit and message of the website (and by extent the individual behind it), one of whimsy and curiosity, is made especially apparent to the visitor through this section. Finally, the Contact page notably features a contact form built using the "form" element and various "input" types.

## Reflection/Evaluation:

The biggest challenge I gave myself was figuring out how to implement the television blur effect that the images of the “current programs” have. It took a lot of trial and error for me to successfully overlay the blur effect (which is actually a gif with low opacity) over the images at the right position with the right proportions. This mainly involved learning how to manipulate the “position” property using the “absolute” and “relative” values alongside the concept of ancestor and descendent elements. Needless to say, it was a success—I learned and implemented new methods and concepts, and the images ended up looking great.

This was a tough but gratifying project to work on, and I especially enjoyed coming up with the concept and making it shine through the content and aesthetic of the website. Though I do wish I had more time and the expertise to polish the website and add more pages and functions, I am satisfied with what I have been able to achieve. It is apparent to me that my familiarity with HTML and CSS has grown a lot since the beginning of this semester, and I look forward to being able to work on bigger projects with more certainty!
